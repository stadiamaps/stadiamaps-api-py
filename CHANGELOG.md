# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Version 7.0.0 - 2025-07-11

### Added

- Support for the v2 `search` (forward geocoding) endpoint! The new API includes better structure, more details, and better address formatting.

```diff
- res = api_instance.search("Telliskivi 60a/3, Tallinn, Estonia")
+ res = api_instance.search_v2("Telliskivi 60a/3, Tallinn, Estonia")
```

For an overview of the structural changes we've made in the V2 API,
refer to the [migration guide](https://docs.stadiamaps.com/geocoding-search-autocomplete/v2-api-migration-guide/).

### Fixed

- **Potentially breaking change:** The `maneuvers` property on route responses was previously marked as required.
  However, it is possible to explicitly request routes with this field removed.
  These would fail validation and the whole request would end with an exception
  in the API client.
  This has been fixed in this version, so the property is optional.

## Version 6.2.0 - 2025-06-03

### Added

* New fields to the time zone API responses including localized timestamps in several standard formats.

### Fixed

* Fix a bug which caused structured search bulk requests to incorrectly spell the `postalcode` field.

## Version 6.2.0 - 2025-04-21

# Added

- Add documentation for the geocoding metadata `query` field.

## Fixed

- Removed boundary circle properties that were mistakenly added.
  They did not behave as expected, so this is a bug fix despite being a code-breaking change if you used it.
- Added missing water layers to context.

## Version 6.1.0 - 2025-04-19

### Added

* Support for the v2 reverse geocoding endpoint! The new API includes better structure, more details, and better address formatting.

```diff
- res = api_instance.reverse(59.444351, 24.750645)
+ res = api_instance.reverse_v2(59.444351, 24.750645)
```

For an overview of the structural changes we've made in the V2 API,
refer to the [migration guide](https://docs.stadiamaps.com/geocoding-search-autocomplete/v2-api-migration-guide/).

### Fixed

* Added the `wheelchair` property to the OSM addendum model (it was in the API response, but not explicitly modeled).
* Fix the types of the Natural Earth and Karmashapes identifiers

## Version 6.0.0 - 2025-04-07

### Added

- Support for the v2 autocomplete and place details APIs!
- **BREAKING:** We have renamed the Place Details method to clarify its purpose.

If you want to keep using the v1 endpoint, you can amend your code like so:

```diff
- res = api_instance.place("Põhja pst 27")
+ res = api_instance.place_details("Põhja pst 27")
```

To upgrade to the v2 Place Details endpoint, which features improved address formatting,
use the new V2 method:

```diff
- res = api_instance.place("Põhja pst 27")
+ res = api_instance.place_details_v2("Põhja pst 27")
```

## Version 5.0.0 - 2025-01-20

### Added

- BREAKING: Renamed models containing Valhalla and Pelias in their names to be generic. These now have rout(e|ing) or geocod(e|ing) prefixes.
- BREAKING: Added additional properties to the "main" feature properties object. This improves accessibility, but if you previously reached into `additional_properties`, you may need to change your code to use the new property directly.
- Adds support for the `foursquare` data source.
- Documents the elevation_interval parameter on certain routing requests.

You will now need to access the `actual_instance` property of API responses that return directions responses.
Aside from this, your existing code should work.

## Version 4.0.0 - 2024-09-04

### Added

- Support for the OSRM format and navigation aids
- BREAKING: To support the new format, the response type of directions APIs has changed

You will now need to access the `actual_instance` property of API responses that return directions responses.
Aside from this, your existing code should work.

```python
res = api_instance.route(req).actual_instance
```

## Version 3.2.0 - 2024-08-15

### Added

- Add support for bulk geocoding

### Fixed

- Isochrone request models now support all costing models

## Version 3.1.0 - 2024-05-11

### Added

- Add support for elevation in route responses

## Version 3.0.0 - 2024-04-30

### Added

- Add support for low-speed vehicle routing
- The matrix endpoint now accepts its own model rather than coordinate. This includes a search cutoff and paves the way for future expansion.

### Changed

- Improved the documentation of the matrix endpoint failure modes

### Fixed

- The time and distance field on matrix source to target models are now marked as nullable
- Enum serialization (broken in the upstream OpenAPI generator)

## Version 2.1.0 - 2024-03-21

### Added

- `ignore_` options for ignoring various restrictions (useful for certain map matching applications)

## Version 2.0.0 - 2024-03-20

### Changed

- BREAKING: Directions Options are moved from a nested object to the root of all turn-by-turn directions APIs. Simply remove the nesting.
- FIXED: Reflect upstream changes to the time/distance matrix API returning a single dimensional list of sources and targets; the extra layer of nesting is removed and may break existing code (this was a bug fix).
- Improved documentation strings.

### Added

- Alley factor for auto costing
- Resample distance parameter to height (elevation) requests
- Support for requesting alternate routes

## Version 1.0.7 - 2023-07-30

### Fixed

- Add missing cases to the travel type enum

## Version 1.0.5 - 2023-06-26

### Changed

- Improve the documentation of ranged elevation responses

## Version 1.0.5 - 2023-06-21

### Fixed

- Add missing `type` to isochrone responses

## Version 1.0.4 - 2023-06-16

### Fixed

- Corrected typo in the `locality_gid` field name
- Add missing `bbox` property to GeoJSON features

## Version 1.0.2 - 1.0.3 - 2023-06-15 - 2023-06-16

### Changed

- Metadata updates
- Minor README improvements

## Version 1.0.0 - 2023-06-13

Initial release!
