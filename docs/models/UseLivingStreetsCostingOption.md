# stadiamaps.model.use_living_streets_costing_option.UseLivingStreetsCostingOption

A measure of willingness to take living streets. Values near 0 attempt to avoid them, and values near 1 will favour them. Note that as some routes may be impossible without living streets, 0 does not guarantee avoidance of them. The default value is 0 for trucks; 0.1 for other motor vehicles; 0.5 for bicycles; and 0.6 for pedestrians.
