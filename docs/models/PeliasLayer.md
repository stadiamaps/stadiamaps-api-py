# stadiamaps.model.pelias_layer.PeliasLayer

Our database is organized into several layers (in the GIS sense of the term) as follows:  - `venue`: Points of interest, businesses, and things with walls - `address`: Places with a street address - `street`: Streets, roads, highways - `county`: Places that issue passports, nations, nation-states - `macroregion`: A related group of regions (mostly in Europe) - `region`: The first administrative division within a country (usually states and provinces) - `macrocounty`: A related group of counties (mostly in Europe) - `county`: Official governmental areas; usually bigger than a locality, but almost always smaller than a region - `locality`: Towns, hamlets, cities, etc. - `localadmin`: Local administrative boundaries - `borough`: Local administrative boundaries within cities (not widely used, but present in places such as NYC and Mexico City) - `neighbourhood`: Social communities and neighborhoods (note the British spelling in the API!) - `postalcode`: Postal codes used by mail services (note: not used for reverse geocoding) - `coarse`: An alias for simultaneously using all administrative layers (everything except `venue` and `address`)
