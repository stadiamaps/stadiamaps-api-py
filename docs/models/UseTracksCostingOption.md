# stadiamaps.model.use_tracks_costing_option.UseTracksCostingOption

A measure of willingness to take track roads. Values near 0 attempt to avoid them, and values near 1 will favour them. Note that as some routes may be impossible without track roads, 0 does not guarantee avoidance of them. The default value is 0 for automobiles, busses, and trucks; and 0.5 for all other costing modes.
